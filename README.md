# Nydus: Dragonfly Container Image Service

<p><img src="misc/logo.svg" width="170"></p>

The nydus project implements a user space filesystem on top of a container image format that improves over the current OCI image specification, in terms of container launching speed, image space, and network bandwidth efficiency, as well as data integrity.

The following benchmarking result shows the performance improvement compared with the OCI image for the container cold startup elapsed time on containerd. As the OCI image size increases, the container startup time of using Nydus image remains very short.

Nydus' key features include:

* Container images are downloaded on demand
* Chunk level data duplication
* Flatten image metadata and data to remove all intermediate layers
* Only usable image data is saved when building a container image
* Only usable image data is downloaded when running a container
* End-to-end image data integrity
* Compatible with the OCI artifacts spec and distribution spec
* Integrated with existing CNCF project Dragonfly to support image distribution in large clusters
* Different container image storage backends are supported

Currently the repository includes following tools:

* A `nydusify` tool to convert an OCI format container image into a nydus format container image
* A `containerd-nydus-grpc` daemon to serve as containerd remote snapshotter and setup container rootfs with nydus
* A `nydus-image` tool to convert an unpacked container image into a nydus format image
* A `nydusd` daemon to parse a nydus format image and expose a FUSE mountpoint for containers to access
